    "# Static HTML Visualizers\n",
    "\n",
    "MeshCat is intended to be used interactively, allowing you to update geometries, transforms, properties, and animations and see the results immediately. But this might not always be what you want. For example, you might want to create and animate a scene and then save that result to a file that you can view later without starting Julia. Or you might want to render a MeshCat visualizer through a remote Jupyter service like JuliaBox or NextJournal, in which case direct communication between the Julia code and your browser is more difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "For situations like these, MeshCat can also provide a *static* rendering of a scene. This static rendering is still fully 3D, and all of the MeshCat mouse controls like zooming, panning, and playing animations will work as normal. The difference is that a static scene has the full description of all the geometries and animations baked in as data, so it can be viewed at any time as long as you have access to a web browser. "
